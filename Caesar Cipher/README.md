## **Introduction 📖**

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This game allows you to encode (encrypt) and decode (decrypt) messages using a specified shift value.

## **Features ✨**

- **Interactive Input**: Enter your message and choose whether to encode or decode it.
- **Shift Customization**: Specify the shift number to control the encryption or decryption.
- **Loop Option**: Continue encoding and decoding messages in a loop until you choose to exit.

## **Installation 💻**

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher-game.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd caesar-cipher-game
   ```
3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher_game.py
   ```

## **How to Play 🎲**

1. Run the script.
2. You will be prompted to type 'encode' to encrypt or 'decode' to decrypt.
3. Enter your message.
4. Enter the shift number (an integer).
5. The script will output the encoded or decoded result.
6. You will be asked if you want to go again. Type 'yes' to continue or 'no' to exit the game.

## **Code Explanation 🔍**

The core logic of the game is implemented in the `caesar` function, which takes the plaintext, shift number, and choice (encode or decode) as arguments. The function shifts each character in the plaintext by the specified number of places and returns the encoded or decoded message.
