# BlackJack Game
### Description
The BlackJack Game is a Python-based implementation of the classic card game Blackjack, also known as Twenty-One. Players compete against the dealer to achieve a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it. This game utilizes the Turtle graphics library to create an interactive and visually appealing experience.

###Installation
To run the game, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required library with the following command:

pip install PythonTurtle

For detailed information, visit the PythonTurtle PyPI page.

### Usage:
Run the main script to start the game. The graphical interface will prompt you to play against the dealer. Use the controls to "hit" (draw a card) or "stand" (end your turn) to get as close to 21 as possible without busting.

### Game Rules:
Card Values: Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, face cards are worth 10 points, and all other cards are worth their face value.
Gameplay: Players can choose to "hit" or "stand". Going over 21 results in a "bust", losing the round.
Winning: The player wins if their hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21. Ties result in a push. Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-point card) pays 3:2.
Additional Options: Players can double their bet on any two-card hand or split pairs into separate hands.
Features
