# **🎲 BlackJack Game**

## **📝 Description**
The BlackJack Game is a Python-based implementation of the classic card game Blackjack, also known as Twenty-One. Players compete against the dealer to achieve a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it. This game involves Python basics and is a simple yet engaging way to practice Python programming.

## **🔧 Installation**
To run the game, ensure you have Python installed. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

## **▶️ Usage**
Run the main script to start the game. The console will prompt you to play against the dealer. Use the controls to "hit" (draw a card) or "stand" (end your turn) to get as close to 21 as possible without busting.

## **📜 Game Rules**
- **Card Values**: Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, face cards are worth 10 points, and all other cards are worth their face value.
- **Gameplay**: Players can choose to "hit" or "stand". Going over 21 results in a "bust", losing the round.
- **Winning**: The player wins if their hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21. Ties result in a push. Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-point card) pays 3:2.
- **Additional Options**: Players can double their bet on any two-card hand or split pairs into separate hands.

## **✨ Features**
- Simple console-based interface.
- Standard Blackjack rules and gameplay.
- Options for hitting, standing, doubling, and splitting.
