Dear Hamza Chamiya,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am excited to share with you that my birthday is just around the corner, on March 21sts. My family is organizing a party for me, and I would be honoured and thrilled if you could join us to celebrate this special day. 

As my best friend, your presence would make this occasion even more memorable. The party will start at 7:00 pm and will include a cake-cutting ceremony and dinner. I sincerely hope that you can make it.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I am eagerly looking forward to seeing you at the party.

Warm Regards,

Muhammad Azeem
